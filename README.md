# GTA Lucky Wheel

This script helps getting the podium vehicle at the lucky wheel.
I included an .ahk file as well, this is so you can edit the script.
To use the .ahk file you need to have *AutoHotkey* installed.
If you don't want to edit the file and just want to use it, you can delete the .ahk and just use the .exe.

From my testing this is quite inconsistent, but I decided to release it anyway
